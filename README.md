# Welcome, I'm Caleb, also known as, imkappy üëã

I‚Äôm a passionate developer with experience in various programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy building projects that challenge my skills and allow me to grow as a developer.

## üå± Current Learning
- Deepening my C# and .NET framework skills to develop scalable, full-stack applications.
- Experimenting with Unity to prototype and design new gameplay mechanics.
- Developing solo projects to improve my coding, math, and problem-solving skills in game development.
- Exploring database management and systems design principles, focusing on relational databases and system architecture
- Practicing **problem-solving** and **critical thinking** by designing and building full-stack systems and games.

While I don't plan to release a full game soon, I enjoy designing systems, creating modular code, and implementing new mechanics even with rough placeholder art and sound.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Languages and Technologies

## üîß Projects
Here are a few of my personal projects that I've worked on:

- [Clicker Game](https://github.com/imkappy/Clicker-Game): A fun idle game made with Unity. Inspired by popular clicker games like **Idle Slayer** and **Clicker Heroes**.
- [HouseRules](https://github.com/imkappy/HouseRules): Built in Unity; features Solitaire and the potential to add other card games.
- [RPG](https://github.com/imkappy/RPG): A partially started attempt to recreate Pokemon Leaf Green with my own twist.
- [FormFiller](https://github.com/imkappy/FormFiller): A C# tool to automate form/survey submissions. 

## üè´ University Class Projects
Below are projects that I have done for classes at the University of Louisville. Some projects were solo and some projects were with a team of other students:

- [Therapy Scheduler](https://github.com/imkappy/Therapy-Scheduler): A system to help a therapy company manage doctor appointments and patient schedules. This project involved **system design**, **technical writing**, **database management** (ERD), and **class modeling**. Worked on both the **technical documentation** and **system architecture** phases.
- [Chicago Art Explorer](https://github.com/imkappy/Chicago-Art-Explorer): Built with **ASP.NET MVC** and **C#**, this web app fetches real-time Chicago public art data using a RESTful API and displays it interactively to users.
