I’m a passionate developer with experience in various programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy building projects that challenge my skills and allow me to grow as a developer.

## 🌱 Current Learning
- Deepening my C# and .NET framework skills to develop scalable, full-stack applications.
- Experimenting with Unity to prototype and design new gameplay mechanics.
- Developing solo projects to improve my coding, math, and problem-solving skills in game development.
- Exploring database management and systems design principles.

While I don't plan to release a full game soon, I enjoy designing systems, creating modular code, and implementing new mechanics even with rough placeholder art and sound.

  A system to help a therapy company manage doctor appointments and patient schedules.  
  This project involves **database management** (ERD), **system design**, and **class modeling** to ensure an efficient scheduling system for healthcare professionals.
